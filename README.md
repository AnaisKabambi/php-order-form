# php-order-form
This is an assignment meant to familiarize yourself with the use of forms in PHP.

# The Objective
At the end of the exercise, the learner is expected to understand and be able to write basic validation, is able to send an email using PHP and is familiar with the superglobals.

# The Experience
This was a difficult exercise for me. I struggled with displaying the error messages and adding the prices together to get a total amount.
However, it was more enjoyable since I already have knowledge of Javascript instead of starting from scratch.
